# Kia ora, I'm Jen :wave:
I'm a full-stack web developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. I graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa in December 2025 with a New Zealand Certificate in Applied Software Development. I also studied a Postgraduate Certificate through Auckland University in 2021, which I completed before taking three years away from study and work to raise a family. Before retraining as a web developer, I worked as a Paralegal/Legal Secretary in a law firm, supporting others in administration roles. I chose to retrain because I enjoy the challenge and found I love building through code. Here are some of the things I have built so far!

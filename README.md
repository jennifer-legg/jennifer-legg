# Kia ora, I'm Jen :wave:
I'm a full-stack web developer based in Auckland, New Zealand with a New Zealand Certificate in Applied Software Development through Dev Academy and a Postgraduate Certificate in Information Technology through Auckland University. 
## About me
I recently completed a part-time boot camp at Dev Academy, principally working with React, Typescript and Javascript, and Knex.js for database queries. 

Before retraining as a web developer, I worked as a Paralegal/Legal Secretary in a law firm, supporting others in administration roles. One of my responsibilities in the firm was updating its website, which required basic knowledge of HTML. I taught myself HTML and CSS and found a sense of satisfaction creating websites out of text. Here are some of the latest things I've built!
## Projects
### [Calendar patience](https://calendar-patience.onrender.com/)
A personal project based on a one-player cardgame from my childhood, this uses the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to create the initial deck and the HTML5 Drag and Drop API to manage the user's interaction with the cards. Built with React, Typescript, Vite, TanStack React Query and Knex.js, I'm currently adding touch events to add playability on mobile and touch screen devices.   

### [Vibing Violet](https://vibing-violet.onrender.com/)
Our final team project with Dev Academy, this is a basic messaging app which takes inspiration from discord and messenger. It uses WebSockets to create a live connection between users and a database to persist message history and user information. TailwindCSS creates a responsive UI and Auth0 is integrated for a secure authorization and login.
